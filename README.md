Preprint of the paper can be found at https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3266750/v1

The code is for a learning-based method to extract symbolic representations of the belief state and its dynamics in order to solve planning problems in a 
continuous-state partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) problem. To improve  accuracy of the abstracted representation, we introduce a memory-dependent abstraction approach to mitigate the modeling error. We use a Neural Network based method to learn the non-Markovian transition model based on the Mori-Zwanzig (M-Z) formalism. The code implement simulation experiment of a underwater vehicle navigation problem as an instance of a continuous-state POMDP to validate the performance of the proposed belief abstraction algorithms.
